# Video Tools

[Youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org) can dowload videos from Youtube. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) can be used to convert them.


The [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) script *youtube-dl_&_ffmpeg.scd* can be used on your computer to download videos from a list of urls (in a *url.txt* file) and to extract shorter portions of them.
